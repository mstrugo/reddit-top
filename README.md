# Reddit Top Entries

## Objective

Make a simple Reddit client that shows the top 50 entries from Reddit - www.reddit.com/top

### What to show

The app should be able to show data from each entry such as:

- Title (at its full length, so take this into account when sizing your cells)
- Author
- entry date, following a format like “x hours ago”
- A thumbnail for those who have a picture.
- Number of comments
- Unread status

### What to include

- Pagination support
- Saving pictures in the picture gallery
- App state-preservation/restoration
- Indicator of unread/read post (updated status, after post it’s selected)
- Dismiss Post Button (remove the cell from list. Animations required)
- Dismiss All Button (remove all posts. Animations required)
- Support split layout (left side: all posts / right side: detail post)
- Responsive design
- Full sized images in a new tab

### Resources

- Reddit API - `http://www.reddit.com/dev/api`
